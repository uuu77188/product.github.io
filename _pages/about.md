微矿荔枝
======
  通过施用含有远古植物吸收的营养矿物的微矿肥种植而得正山小种

  微矿肥，由南科大刘科院士团队，通过技术攻关，将通过微纳分离技术从远古植物化石——煤炭中分离的营养矿物，与矿物释放微生物，微生物营养剂等成分有机结合制得。在山东、福建、山西、贵州、河南等地，与当地农科院所及企业，通过80多季的茶叶、玉米、高粱等作物大田实验，结果表明可提高植物微量元素含量，降低亚硝酸盐含量，提升作物品质及产量。产品获得国际CMA认证及国家肥料生产资质。

甲醇经济
======
  远古植物化石通过微矿分离后的有机部分，是优质的甲醇原料。其与风光资源结合，可利用中国最便宜的两种资源，实现大规模的、符合中国发展需要的长期化学储能方案，促进中国能源的绿色化。

  刘科院士团队围绕甲醇经济，针对上下游产业链产业痛点，从原料预处理、甲醇制备，终端应用三个方向展开相关技术攻坚工作，形成了微矿分离、土壤改良、类液体燃料、生物质预处理、高效气化技术、制醇催化剂开发、甲醇动力、甲醇热力、及甲醇电力等九大创新性技术。微矿分离技术从源头解决煤炭的污染问题、以及大量使用化肥造成的土地板结与食品安全问题，该技术已在山东鲁南化工园区完成五千吨/年工业放大及五十万吨/年工程示范。微矿矿物可作为土壤改良、瓷器原料、建材原料等，可用于肥料、瓷器、建材等生产。在终端运用端，甲醇通过甲醇发动机、工业锅炉、燃料电池等转化为动力、热力、电力，实现汽车、钢铁业、农业、陶瓷业等分布式用能场景的能源清洁化。

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
